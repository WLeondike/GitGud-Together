# GitGud Together-- A Friend Finding Service for Steam Gamers

Based on your favorite games and favorite genres, you can find other gamer friends on the Steam Platform who like the same games as you. Play together. Win together. Lose Together. Git Gud @ Gaming Together... <br>
...Palm slap to my face for saying that... <br>

We take advantage of data from the Steam API and a preexisting database of all the current steam games to match compatible users together and help foster digital relationships across the planet. <br>
This is essentially a big data application and users can be matched based on anything, from country of origin, user birthdate... to the speed of internet connection. The possibilities are endless. Eventually even Machine Learning algorithms could be used to discover what is the best way to match Steam Gamers together based on the data.
